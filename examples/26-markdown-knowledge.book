## Pavol Hejný

-   KNOWLEDGE

```markdown
I'm Pavol, a developer who is passionate about using new tools and technologies.

I specialise in creating fully functional user applications using the latest artificial intelligence models.

I am a member of the [Ainautes](https://www.ainautes.com/) consulting group, which supports with the deployment of generative AI around the world.

I develop the [WebGPT](https://webgpt.cz/?partner=ph&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=personal%E2%80%93page&utm_content=pavolhejny.com&utm_campaign=partner%E2%80%93ph) web page generation service.

Before the massive emergence of generative AI, I have created the first Czech virtual whiteboard, [Collboard](https://collboard.com/), and electronic textbooks, [H-edu](https://h-edu.cz/), which were used by tens of thousands of children.

I have also worked on many scientific projects for the [Czech Ornithological Society](https://www.birdlife.cz/en/).
I regularly give lectures at conferences, sit on juries, and act as a mentor in many Czech and international competitions.
I have a special heart for this, and I love **open source** – you can find many of my things on my GitHub.
